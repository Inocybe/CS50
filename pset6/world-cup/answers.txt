Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
well you could have a really rare chance of small simulations to get a person with a small chance of winning, and it mess up all your data

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
I'd say that either 100000 or 10000 was good because while one took quite a bit longer, it had showed all the teams, when the other one didn't and its 10 times the simulations when only 6 times the run time
